    "## Computational tools in ChBE 102\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemical reaction engineering we will face a number of scenarios which are intractable to solve by hand and will therefore rely on computational tools to connect our understanding of reactor design fundamentals to solving realistic problems. The basic tools we consistently require are ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers and non-linear systems of equations solvers. Throughout the course we will discuss how to use these efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python to this end due to its open-source nature and adaptability - you can use it for far more than just chemical engineering math. Python on its own is only a lanuage, however. To use it, we could either work from a command line (not recommended) or from an \"Integrated Development Environment\" or IDE. Examples include Spyder, PyCharm, Thonny, Atom, Jupyter Notebooks, and JupyterLab. By contrast, MATLAB is both a language *and* its own IDE. These IDEs allow you to import \"packages\" that let you perform various calculations, visualizations, and data manipulations with editable code. Spyder looks similar to MATLAB and is a great choice for troubleshooting but not for displaying and sharing data. Jupyter Notebooks are much better for this, which is why we will use them in ChBE 102. Jupyter Notebooks can also be used to process different computing languages such as R, Julia, Octave, and even MATLAB. Additionally, a number of virtual environments based on the notebook's cousin JupyterLab are also commonly available/generatable (e.g., Binder-rendered GitHub repositories).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use whichever IDE you prefer to create and edit your codes in, but you will ultimately need to turn in a printed Jupyter Notebook (usually it's quick to just copy/paste).\n",
    "\n",
    "**TO START** it is strongly suggested that you access Python through the Anaconda distribution. Anaconda is a \"distribution\" of Python meaning that it includes the code, packages, IDEs, and various utilities to manage packages. The installation is free and easy."

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks consist of multiple \"cells\" with different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raw cells**: the text in these will not be reformatted or really \"interpreted\" in any way \n",
    "- **Markdown cells**: these contain formatted text and LaTeX equations (this is a Markdown cell)\n",
    "- **Code cells**: these contain executable commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the commands in a cell or format it, you can press \"Shift-Enter\" or the \"Run\" button at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Raw cell, nothing will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Markdown cell, all of the formatting will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Code cell, calculations will be performed and global variables will be saved. These can then be accessed in other code cells. **The spatial order of code cells does not matter - only the order in which the cells are run.** It is generally better to order them in the order you would like to run them, however. There is no native variable explorer to see what you have defined so the best way to check which variables have been defined and what their values are is to just print them. A variable explorer can be added with notebook extensions, however, which will be noted momentarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever want to **reset your variables** you can do so by going to **Kernel/Restart**. All program definitions will also be lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of these notebooks is that they show the output of a code right below it after execution. This makes it easier to understand how a code operates (especially since you can add your own clarifications in Markdown cells)."

    "\n",
    "When transitioning to a \"literate\" form of programming like Jupyter Notebooks from a \"non-literate\" form of programming (e.g., Spyder), some debugging tools can be lost. Jupyter Notebook is currently missing a few ideal features that can be found with nb_extensions. Once downloaded, you can enable them in the main Jupyter screen under the \"Nbextentions\" tab.\n",
